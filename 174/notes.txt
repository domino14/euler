- difference of squares problem
- how many different ways can we express t as a difference of two squares?
- for the example given t = 32 => 6^2 - 2^2 or 9^2 - 7^2
t = a^2 - b^2

ceil the square root of the number.. that is your starting number. 'a' above can NOT be 
smaller than this ceiled sqroot (call it c).

cheap method -- take c, square it, subtract iteration variable squared (iteration variable goes up to c - 1)
then keep increasing c. stop when c^2 - (c-2)^2 > t
     	  	     	     	  c^2 - (c^2-4c+4) > t
				  4c - 4 > t

a more reasonable stopping point is when we just don't have that many squares
stop when (c-2)*4 + 4 > t (same thing dammit)


to possess vertical and horizontal symmetry a&b must both be odd or even
